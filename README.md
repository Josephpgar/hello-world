Hello, I am Joseph Garcia. I was born and currently reside in Texas. I did my undergraduate studies at Texas Tech University in Economics and currently work there. I decided to pursue Data Science because I enjoy analyzing data. I can speak Japanese at a N4 level, and my favorite person is my wife, who always supports me.
